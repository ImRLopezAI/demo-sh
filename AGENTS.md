# UI/UX Guidelines

WHEN USING PENCIL MCP TO CREATES VIEWS, COMPONENTS, OR ANYTHING RELATED TO THE UI, CREATE UNIQUE DESIGNS AND DISTINCTIVE LAYOUTS. DO NOT COPY THE SAME DESIGN PATTERNS AND LAYOUTS ACROSS MODULES. EACH MODULE SHOULD HAVE A UNIQUE LOOK AND FEEL REFLECTING ITS FUNCTIONALITY AND PURPOSE. 

AFTER CREATE A VIEW ANALYZE AND COMPARE IT WITH THE OTHER VIEWS IN THE SAME MODULE AND MAKE SURE THEY HAVE A CONSISTENT DESIGN LANGUAGE AND LAYOUT STRUCTURE. HOWEVER, WHEN COMPARING VIEWS ACROSS DIFFERENT MODULES, ENSURE THAT EACH VIEW HAS A DISTINCTIVE DESIGN AND LAYOUT THAT SETS IT APART FROM THE OTHERS, REFLECTING THE UNIQUE FUNCTIONALITY AND PURPOSE OF ITS MODULE.

AVOID AI-Generated Generic Layouts and Designs that Look Similar Across Modules. INSTEAD, STRIVE FOR CREATIVITY AND UNIQUENESS IN EACH MODULE'S UI TO ENHANCE USER EXPERIENCE AND MAKE IT EASIER FOR USERS TO NAVIGATE AND IDENTIFY DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF THE APPLICATION.

For ui use the skill `frontend-design` `vercel-react-best-practices`, `web-design-guidelines` and `vercel-composition-patterns`. 

## Quick Commands

Install deps:
- `bun install`

Development servers:(Normally you wouldn't need to run cause I always run in dev mode, but here you go)
- `bun run dev` (vinext dev server on :3000)

Build & run:
- `bun run build`
- `bun run start` (vinext start on :3000)
- `bun run preview` (Vite preview server)

Tests:
- `bun run test`
- `bun run test:e2e`

Typecheck:
- `bun run typecheck`

Lint/format (Biome):
- `bun run lint` (runs `biome check --write --unsafe .`)



## Project Layout

- `src/app/**` vinext App Router routes, layouts, and API handlers
- `src/app/_shell/**` Shell routing, navigation config, and per-module view loading

- `src/components/**` UI + layout components (REUSABLE COMPONENTS ONLY, no module-specific components)
- `src/lib/**` shared utilities, env helpers, Redis, router helpers, RPC client
- `src/server/**` server-side helpers, Hono API wiring, DB schema definitions, RPC routers
- `test/**` Vitest + Playwright tests
